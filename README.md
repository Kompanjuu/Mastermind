I found some bugs in middle beaccuse function can modify global variables and i wasnt aware of that.
also solved the issue of making x and check when theres only meant to be a check.

Finished the game. now it is fucntional but not perfect. 
What has been fixed:
We fixed the puh (user input) but right now the comments are weird,
Moved around some lines in main to make it more readable such as
putting
memory_numbers.append(user_input) 
memory_results.append(round_resuls)
beside each other. 

Improve next time:
- Some messages have to be edited (We can make it more aesthetic)
- in puh: I would prefer if it printed out all the issues at the end rather than only one comment directly and the breaking when it finds an issue
- change name of files or function names.
