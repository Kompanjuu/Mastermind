all in a while loop


    1. DONE (refer to Hanna)
    Generate a four number combination:
    random 1-6 and include them too.
        One with no repeating
        one that can be repeating

    2. Gustaf wip
    start:
    Welcome message
    mode

    in a loop: 12 rundor
        3. 
        Input:
        Input message
        make sure its 4 numbers (not other characters)
        remove spaces.
        within range (1-6)

        4. 
        Middle part, if number is included in the number make it square
        a for loop could work
            if num in the combination
                make it square
            if in right positio
                make the square into check

            alternativt:
                make checks first
                check for squares

            5. making the output layout
            Output everytime theres an input
            you want to output it prettey.

    6. 
    When game is finished:
    ending message
    if stay
        while lop still true
    if exit
        while loop ends

        Goodbye message
